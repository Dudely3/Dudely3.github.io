# About Me
  
My name is Addison! I'm a mom of 3, an avid gardener, and a professional software developer. I've been making websites of one kind or another since 1999, when I built a small HTML site in notepad that I hosted on my ISP's free web server space (remember when they used to do THAT?).

After going to college and getting the same associate's degree that my father had, my professional career started in 2008 with my local government, where I worked in the department that handled student loans. They were using an old mainframe application to process loans and it was costing a lot to maintain the server. So I helped them develop a winforms app and SQL database to process them instead, as well as developing an online version of the student loan application.

After that project was complete, in early 2013 I got a job at a software company called Clearview. I worked on an online SaaS platform that the fast food industry used as their back-office solution. It covered sales, inventory, timecards, and scheduling- a huge domain with millions of lines of code. The site was coded in ASP.Net site backed by VB and SQL server, but eventually all new development was in C#, and we started to move toward a hybrid cloud solution instead of fully on-prem. I also developed many different back end APIs and services that performed quite a few different B2B processes- like ordering more food from suppliers, or processing live sales from a POS. I also designed complex database structures to allow for scalable, fully reconfigurable systems. Remember when fast food companies started adding all sorts of new features like kiosks and online ordering? Well it was my system designs that allowed them to rapidly make those changes and see the actual impact they had on sales without requiring any new development.

In mid-2022 I got an amazing opportunity to work for an AI company called Cogniva. I helped them improve their code in many different ways, including upgrading the .Net version, moving their build to the cloud, and splitting the huge, monolithic code base apart using internal NuGet packages. I also designed and build APIs to allow them to bid on different contracts, because at first their ML-algorithms were only able to interact with CDNs like Sharepoint. I built a svelte app to help configure the AI models, a GraghQL app to help data scientists analyze data, and a Blazor API that other software companies could deploy to AWS and use to run Cogniva's proprietary algorithms.

Unfortunately, I was laid off from Cogniva recently and I'm still looking for a new role. If you know anyone who needs a developer with skills like mine, please let me know!
