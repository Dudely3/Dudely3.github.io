	<h1>Hi there, I'm Addison. This is my personal site where I showcase my work and keep my notes</h1>
	
	<p> I do a lot of work with C# .Net, building APIs and working with various types of databases and cloud providers. 
		I was in a restrictive non-compete contract until recently, so my github has nothing public during that time.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="/wiki">📚 Personal Wiki</a> for my notes and most of this site's content.</li>
		<li><a href="/wiki/navigation-guide">🧭 Index</a> to see a table of contents.</li>
		<li><a href="/blog">🛖 Blog</a> Still a Work in Progress.</li>
		<li><a href="/about">🏝️ About</a> To learn more about me.</li>
	</ul>

	<p> You can also contact me through any of these channels. </p> </div>
